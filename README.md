## Week 1: Project Initiation & Dataset Preparation

### Goals:
- Understand project scope and objectives under GreenSkill Internship.
- Study existing approaches for waste classification using AI.
- Identify dataset requirements and gather sample images of garbage types (organic, recyclable, hazardous).

### Work Done:
- Researched on CNN-based image classification for garbage.
- Collected and cleaned dataset with 4 main classes: Organic, Recyclable, E-waste, and Hazardous.
- Organized dataset into folders per class.
- Uploaded sample dataset to GitHub repository.

### Challenges Faced:
- Dataset imbalance: Recyclable had more images than others.
- Renamed and preprocessed all image files to avoid errors in model training.

### Improvisation:
- Used `OpenCV` and `Pillow` libraries to resize and clean images.
- Reduced noisy backgrounds using contour masking.
- Set up a clear folder structure for easy model training and updates.
