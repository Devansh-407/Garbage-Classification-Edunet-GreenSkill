# Garbage Classification CNN Project

## 📅 Week 1: Dataset Setup
- Uploaded custom garbage dataset with 6 classes:
  - paper, plastic, glass, metal, cardboard, trash
- Organized into proper folder structure for classification
- Added sample images for each class

## 📅 Week 2: Model Training
- Trained CNN model using TensorFlow & Keras on Google Colab
- Achieved ~93% training accuracy and ~66% validation accuracy
- Saved model as `garbage_classifier_model.h5`
- Added training notebook `model_training.ipynb` to repository

## 🧠 Tools & Tech Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib
